Nodes represent ligands or receptors expressed in the denoted cell 
type, and edges represent protein-protein interactions between them. Node color
represents magnitude of differential gene expression (logFC as estimated by the MAST
model), such that the most significantly age-upregulated genes are in magenta, and age
downregulated are in blue. Node borders indicate statistical significance of differential
expression, specifically the false-discovery rate expected from the MAST analysis. Edge
color represents the sum of scaled differential expression magnitudes from each 
contributing node, while width and transparency are determined by the magnitude of
scaled differential expression (see full Methods below).
